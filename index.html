            Punjab (/pʌnˈdʒɑːb/ (About this soundlisten), Punjabi: [pənˈdʒaːb])
            is a state in northern India. Forming part of the larger Punjab
            region of the Indian subcontinent, the state is bordered by the
            Indian union territories of Jammu and Kashmir to the north,
            Chandigarh to the east, the Indian states of Himachal Pradesh to the
            north and northeast, Haryana to the south and southeast, and
            Rajasthan to the southwest. It is bordered by Punjab, a province of
            Pakistan to the west.[10] The state covers an area of 50,362 square
            kilometres (19,445 square miles), 1.53% of India's total
            geographical area.[11] It is the 20th-largest Indian state by area.
            With 27 million inhabitants at the 2011 census, Punjab is the
            16th-largest state by population, comprising 22 districts.[5][12]
            Punjabi, written in the Gurmukhi script, is the most widely spoken
            and official language of the state.[13] The main ethnic group are
            the Punjabis, with Sikhs (57.7%) and Hindus (38.5%) as the dominant
            religious groups.[14] The state capital is Chandigarh, a Union
            Territory and also the capital of the neighbouring state of Haryana.
            The five tributary rivers of the Indus River from which the region
            took its name are the Sutlej, Ravi, Beas, Chenab and Jhelum rivers;
            the Sutlej, Ravi and Beas rivers flow through the Indian Punjab.[15]
            The history of Punjab has witnessed the migration and settlement of
            different tribes of people with different cultures and ideas,
            forming a melting pot of Punjabi civilisation. The first traces of
            human habitation in India were found in the Punjab region. The Indus
            Valley Civilization flourished in antiquity before recorded history
            until their decline around 1900 BCE.[16] The Punjab has had numerous
            recorded invasions, starting with the Rigvedic tribes. Punjab was
            enriched during the height of the Vedic period, but declined in
            predominance with the rise of the Mahajanapadas.[17] The region
            formed the frontier of initial empires during antiquity including
            the Achaemenid, Alexander's,[18] Seleucid, and Maurya[19] Empires.
            After the fall of the Maurya Empire, the region was splintered into
            multiple kingdoms and republics. Punjab was subsequently conquered
            by the Kushan Empire, Gupta Empire,[20] and then Harsha's
            Empire.[21] Punjab continued to be settled by nomadic people;
            including the Huna, Turkic and the Mongols. Circa 1000, the Punjab
            came under the rule of Muslims[22] and was part of the Delhi
            Sultanate,[23][24] Mughal Empire,[25][26] and Durrani Empire.[27]
            Sikhism was founded in the 1500s and 1600s by the Sikh Gurus in the
            Punjab and resulted in the formation of the Sikh Confederacy after
            the fall of the Mughal Empire and ensuing conflict with the Durrani
            Empire.[28] This confederacy was united into the Sikh Empire in 1801
            by Maharaja Ranjit Singh.[29][30] The greater Punjab region was
            annexed by the British East India Company from the Sikh Empire in
            1849.[31] In 1947, the Punjab Province of British India was divided
            along religious lines into West Punjab and East Punjab.[32] The
            western part was assimilated into Pakistan, an Islamic republic
            while the east became part of India, a secular state. After the
            Punjabi Suba movement, the Indian Punjab and PEPSU were divided into
            three parts on the basis of language in 1966.[33] Haryanvi and Hindi
            speaking areas (including various dialects) were carved out as
            Haryana, while the hilly regions and Pahari-speaking areas formed
            Himachal Pradesh, alongside the current state of Punjab. An
            insurgency occurred in Punjab during the 1980s.[34] At present, the
            economy of Punjab is the 15th-largest state economy in India with
            ₹5.75 trillion (US$81 billion) in gross domestic product and a per
            capita GDP of ₹167,000 (US$2,300), ranking 16th amongst Indian
            states.[6] Since independence Punjab is predominantly an agrarian
            economy. It is the ninth-highest ranking among Indian states in
            human development index.[7] The state's bustling tourism,
            music,[35][36] culinary, and film[37][38] industries contribute to
            the state's economy as well, and are amongst the largest in India
            despite the state's small size and population, including India's
            largest music industry

          <h3>Geography</h3>
          <p>
            Punjab is in northwestern India and has a total area of 50,362
            square kilometres (19,445 sq mi). Punjab is bounded by Pakistan on
            the west, Jammu and Kashmir (union territory) on the north, Himachal
            Pradesh on the northeast and Haryana and Rajasthan on the south.[8]
            Most of the Punjab lies in a fertile, alluvial plain with many
            rivers and an extensive irrigation canal system.[70] A belt of
            undulating hills extends along the northeastern part of the state at
            the foot of the Himalayas. Its average elevation is 300 metres (980
            ft) above sea level, with a range from 180 metres (590 ft) in the
            southwest to more than 500 metres (1,600 ft) around the northeast
            border. The southwest of the state is semiarid, eventually merging
            into the Thar Desert. The Shiwalik Hills extend along the
            northeastern part of the state at the foot of the
            Himalayas.[citation needed] The soil characteristics are influenced
            to a limited extent by the topography, vegetation and parent rock.
            The variation in soil profile characteristics are much more
            pronounced because of the regional climatic differences.[71] Punjab
            is divided into three distinct regions on the basis of soil types:
            southwestern, central, and eastern. Punjab falls under seismic zones
            II, III, and IV. Zone II is considered a low-damage risk zone; zone
            III is considered a moderate-damage risk zone; and zone IV is
            considered a high-damage risk zone.
          </p>
          <h3>Government and politics</h3>
          <p>
            Punjab is governed through a parliamentary system of representative
            democracy. Each of the states of India possesses a parliamentary
            system of government, with a ceremonial state Governor, appointed by
            the President of India on the advice of the central government. The
            head of government is an indirectly elected Chief Minister who is
            vested with most of the executive powers. The term length of the
            government is five years. The state legislature, the Vidhan Sabha,
            is the unicameral Punjab Legislative Assembly, with 117 members
            elected from single-seat constituencies.[79] The current government
            was elected in the 2017 Assembly elections as Congress won 77 out of
            117 Assembly seats and Amarinder Singh is the current Chief
            Minister. The state of Punjab is divided into five administrative
            divisions and twenty-two districts. The capital of Punjab is
            Chandigarh, which also serves as the capital of Haryana and is thus
            administered separately as a Union Territory of India. The judicial
            branch of the state government is provided by the Punjab and Haryana
            High Court in Chandigarh.[80] The two major political parties in the
            state are the Shiromani Akali Dal, a right-wing party allied with
            the Bharatiya Janata Party at the national level, and the Indian
            National Congress, a centrist party.[81] The present government is
            headed by Amarinder Singh. President's rule has been imposed in
            Punjab eight times so far, since 1950, for different reasons. In
            terms of the absolute number of days, Punjab was under the
            President's rule for 3,510 days, which is approximately 10 years.
            Much of this was in the 80s during the height of militancy in
            Punjab. Punjab was under the President's rule for five continuous
            years from 1987 to 1992. Punjab state law and order is maintained by
            Punjab Police. Punjab police is headed by its DGP, Dinkar Gupta,[82]
            and has 70,000 employees. It manages state affairs through 22
            district heads known as SSP.

          <h3>Economy</h3>
          <p>
            Punjab's GDP is ₹5.75 trillion (US$81 billion).[4][84] Punjab is one
            of the most fertile regions in India. The region is ideal for
            wheat-growing. Rice, sugar cane, fruits and vegetables are also
            grown. Indian Punjab is called the "Granary of India" or "India's
            bread-basket".[85] It produces 10.26% of India's cotton, 19.5% of
            India's wheat, and 11% of India's rice. The Firozpur and Fazilka
            Districts are the largest producers of wheat and rice in the state.
            In worldwide terms, Indian Punjab produces 2% of the world's cotton,
            2% of its wheat and 1% of its rice.[85] Punjab ranked first in GDP
            per capita amongst Indian states in 1981 and fourth in 2001, but has
            experienced slower growth than the rest of India, having the
            second-slowest GDP per capita growth rate of all Indian states and
            UTs between 2000 and 2010, behind only
            Manipur.[86][87][88][89][90][91][92] Punjab's economy has been
            primarily agriculture-based since the Green Revolution due to the
            presence of abundant water sources and fertile soils;[93] most of
            the state lies in a fertile alluvial plain with many rivers and an
            extensive irrigation canal system.[70] The largest cultivated crop
            is wheat. Other important crops are rice, cotton, sugarcane, pearl
            millet, maize, barley and fruit. Rice and wheat are doublecropped in
            Punjab with rice stalks being burned off over millions of acres
            prior to the planting of wheat. This widespread practice is
            polluting and wasteful.[94] Despite covering only 1.53%[9] of its
            geographical area, Punjab makes up for about 15-20%[95][96][97][98]
            of India's wheat production, around 12%[99][100][101][102] of its
            rice production, and around 5%[95][103][104][105] of its milk
            production, being known as India's breadbasket.[106][107] About
            80%[108]-95%[109] of Punjab's agricultural land is owned by its Jat
            Sikh community despite it only forming 21%[110] of the state's
            population. About 10% of Punjab's population is made up of migrants
            from poorer states to the southeast such as Uttar Pradesh and Bihar
            who work as farm labourers.[111] Other major industries include
            financial services, the manufacturing of scientific instruments,
            agricultural goods, electrical goods, machine tools, textiles,
            sewing machines, sports goods, starch, fertilisers, bicycles,
            garments, and the processing of pine oil and sugar.[107] Minerals
            and energy resources also contribute to Punjab's economy to a much
            lesser extent. Punjab has the largest number of steel rolling mill
            plants in India, which are in "Steel Town"—Mandi Gobindgarh in the
            Fatehgarh Sahib district. Punjab also has a large diaspora that is
            mostly settled in the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada,
            numbers about 3 million, and sends back billions of USD in
            remittances to the state, playing a major role in its economy.[112]
            In Punjab the consumption of fertiliser per hectare is 223.46 kg as
            compared to 90 kg nationally. The state has been awarded the
            National Productivity Award for agriculture extension services for
            ten years, from 1991 to 1992 to 1998–99 and from 2001 to 2003–04. In
            recent years a drop in productivity has been observed, mainly due to
            falling fertility of the soil. This is believed to be due to
            excessive use of fertilisers and pesticides over the years. Another
            worry is the rapidly falling water table on which almost 90% of the
            agriculture depends; alarming drops have been witnessed in recent
            years. By some estimates, groundwater is falling by a meter or more
            per year.[113][114] According to the India State Hunger Index,
            Punjab has the lowest level of hunger in India.
          </p>
          <h3>Religion</h3>
          <p>
            Punjab has the largest population of Sikhs in India and is the only
            state where Sikhs form a majority, numbering around 16 million
            forming 57.69% of the state population.[11] Hinduism is the second
            largest religion in the Indian state of Punjab numbering around
            10.68 million and forming 38.49% of the state's population and a
            majority in Doaba region. Islam is followed by 535,489 accounting
            1.93% of the population and are mainly concentrated in Malerkotla
            and Qadian. Other smaller segments of religions existing in Punjab
            are Christianity practised by 1.26%, Jainism practised by 0.16%,
            Buddhism practised by 0.12% and others 0.36%. Sikhs form a majority
            in 17 districts out of the total 22 districts while Hindus form the
            majority in five districts namely, Pathankot, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur,
            Fazilka and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar districts.[128] The Sikh
            shrine, Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib), is in the city of Amritsar,
            which houses the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee, the
            topmost Sikh religious body. The Sri Akal Takht Sahib, which is
            within the Golden Temple complex, is the highest temporal seat of
            Sikhs. Of the five Takhts (Temporal Seats of religious authority) of
            Sikhism, three are in Punjab. These are Sri Akal Takht Sahib,
            Damdama Sahib and Anandpur Sahib. At least one Sikh Gurdwara can be
            found in almost every village in the state, as well as in the towns
            and cities (in various architectural styles and sizes). Before the
            advent of Islam, and later birth of Sikhism, Hinduism was the main
            religion practised by the Punjabi people. Due to the non-exclusive
            nature of their religion, a segment of Punjabis who are categorised
            as Punjabi Hindus continue heterogeneous religious practices in
            spiritual kinship with Sikhism. This not only includes veneration of
            the Sikh Gurus in private practice but also visits to Sikh Gurdwaras
            in addition to Hindu temples.
