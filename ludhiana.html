            Ludhiana is a city and a municipal corporation in Ludhiana district
            in the Indian state of Punjab. Ludhiana is Punjab's largest city and
            the largest city situated north of Delhi. The city has an area of
            159 km2 (61 sq mi)[4] and an estimated population of 1,618,879 as of
            the 2011 census.[5] The city stands on the old bank of Sutlej River,
            that is now 13 kilometres (8.1 mi) to the south of its present
            course. It is an industrial center of northern India, often referred
            to as India's Manchester by BBC.[7] Ludhiana is among the list of
            smart cities that will be developed by government of India and has
            been ranked as the easiest city in India for business according to
            the World Bank. Ludhiana is 107 kilometres (66 mi) west of the state
            capital, Chandigarh, and is centrally located on National Highway
            44, which runs from New Delhi to Amritsar. It is 315 km (194 miles)
            north of Delhi and 142 km (88 miles) southeast of Amritsar.

          <h3>Geography</h3>
          <p>
            Ludhiana is located at 30.9°N 75.85°E.[8] It has an average
            elevation of 244 metres (798 ft). Ludhiana City, to its residents,
            consists of the Old City and the New City. The new city primarily
            consists of the Civil Lines area which was historically known as the
            residential and official quarters of the colonial British
            encampment. The land dips steeply to the north and the west where,
            before 1785, the river Sutlej ran.[citation needed] The Old Fort was
            at the banks of the Sutlej (and now houses the College of Textile
            Engineering). Legend has it that a tunnel connects it to the fort in
            Phillaur – although why this should be is debatable, as the Sutlej
            was the traditional dividing line between the principalities, often
            occupied by enemy forces (see History section). The ground is of
            yellow sandstone and granite, forming small hillocks, plateaus and
            dips.[citation needed] The tree of largest natural extraction was
            the kikar, or Acacia Indica, but has been supplanted by the
            eucalyptus, transplanted from rural Australia in the late 1950s by
            the government of Chief Minister Pratap Singh Kairon. Gulmohars and
            jacarandas were planted by the British along the avenues of Civil
            Lines, as were other flowering trees, while the Old City contains
            almost no vegetation or parks, except for a few isolated pipal
            trees, holy to the Hindus, as it is supposed to be the abode of Lord
            Shiva.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Ludhiana was founded in 1480 by members of the ruling Lodhi dynasty
            of the Delhi Sultanate.[14] The ruling sultan, Sikandar Lodhi,
            dispatched two ruling chiefs, Yusaf Khan and Nihand Khan, to
            re-assert Lodhi control. The two men camped at the site of present
            Ludhiana, which was then a village called Mir Hota. Yusaf Khan
            crossed the Sutlej and established Sultanpur, while Nihand Khan
            founded Ludhiana on the site of Mir Hota. The name was originally
            "Lodhi-ana", meaning "Lodhi town", which has since shifted from
            "Lodiana" to the present form of Ludhiana.[15] The Lodhi Fort, or
            "Purana Qila", is the only surviving structure in the city from this
            period; located in the neighbourhood of Fatehgarh, it was
            well-maintained under Ranjit Singh and the British after him, but
            then fell into disrepair. It was declared a state-protected monument
            in December 2013.[16] The Semi Centennial Celebration of the
            American Presbyterian Lodiana Mission was held in Ludhiana from
            December 3–7, 1884
          </p>
          <h3>Religion</h3>
          <p>
            With around 66% adherents according to 2011 Indian Census, Hinduism
            is the predominant religion of Ludhiana, followed by Sikhism with
            29% of the population. Islam is followed by around 3% and
            Christianity by less than 1%.[18] Prior to India's partition,
            Ludhiana had a population of 111,639 with Muslims being the majority
            with 63%. The Hindus were 31% and Sikhs 5%. It changed
            post-partition with a drastic reduction in Muslim percentage and
            simultaneous increase in Hindu and Sikh population, owing to
            migration of people between West and East Punjab
          </p>
          <h3>Economy</h3>
          <p>
            The World Bank ranked Ludhiana as the city in India with the best
            business environment in 2009 and 2013.[21] The riches are brought
            mostly by small-scale industrial units,[22] which produce industrial
            goods, machine parts, auto parts, household appliances, hosiery,
            apparel, and garments. Ludhiana is Asia's largest hub for bicycle
            manufacturing and produces more than 50% of India's bicycle
            production of more than 10 million each year. Ludhiana produces 60%
            of India's tractor parts and a large portion of auto and two-wheeler
            parts. Many parts used in German cars such as Mercedes and BMW are
            exclusively produced in Ludhiana to satisfy the world requirement.
            It is one of the largest manufacturer of domestic sewing machines.
            Hand tools and industrial equipment are other specialties. Ludhiana
            contribute most to Punjab than any other city.[citation needed]
            Feroze Gandhi Market, Ludhiana The apparel industry of Ludhiana,
            popularly known as Ludhiana hosiery industry provides employment to
            millions of people[23] and produces India's largest share of winter
            clothing. It is especially known for its woollen sweaters and cotton
            T-shirts with the majority of India's woollen clothing brands being
            based here. Ludhiana is also famous for its industry of shawls and
            stoles and satisfies the demand of major domestic and international
            brands. As a result of its dominance in the textile industry it is
            often dubbed as the Manchester of India.[24] Ludhiana also has a
            growing IT sector with multiple software services and product
            companies having development centers in the city. Ludhiana is also
            home to the Ludhiana Stock Exchange Association. LSC is situated on
