            Patiala is a city in southeastern Punjab, northwestern India. It is
            the fourth largest city in the state and is the administrative
            capital of Patiala district. Patiala is located around the Qila
            Mubarak (the 'Fortunate Castle') constructed by the Sidhu Jat
            chieftain Ala Singh, who founded the royal dynasty of Patiala State
            in 1763, and after whom the city is named. In popular culture, the
            city remains famous for its traditional Patiala shahi turban (a type
            of headgear), paranda (a tasselled tag for braiding hair), Patiala
            salwar (a type of female trousers), jutti (a type of footwear) and
            Patiala peg (a measure of liquor).
          </p>
          <h3>Etymology</h3>
          <p>
            'Patiala' comes from the roots pati and ala, the former is Urdu for
            a "strip of land" and 'ala' comes from the name of the founder of
            the city, Ala Singh. So, 'Patiala' can be translated into English to
            mean ‘the land of Ala’.
          </p>
          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            Patiala state was established in 1763 by Ala Singh, who laid the
            foundation of the Patiala fort known as Qila Mubarak, around 'which
            the present city of Patiala is built. After the Third Battle of
            Panipat in 1761 in which the Marathas were defeated by the Afghans,
            the writ of the Afghans prevailed throughout Punjab. It is at this
            stage that the rulers of Patiala began to acquire ensigns of
            royalty. The Patiala state saw more than forty years of a ceaseless
            power struggle with the Afghan Durrani Empire, Maratha Empire and
            the Sikh Empire of Lahore. In 1808, the Raja of Patiala entered into
            a treaty with the British against Sikh ruler Maharaja Ranjit Singh
            of Lahore in 1808, thus becoming collaborator in the grand empire
            building process by the British in, the sub-continent of India.
            Patiala became a 17-guns salute state during the British Raj. The
            rulers of Patiala such as Karam Singh, Narinder Singh, Mahendra
            Singh, Rajinder Singh, Bhupinder Singh, and Yadvindra Singh were
            treated with respect and dignity by the British. The Darshani Gate
            (the main gate of the Qila Mubarak), built in the 18th century. The
            city was built around the fort. The city of Patiala was designed and
            developed according to a plan akin to that of temple architecture,
            the first settlers of Patiala were the Hindus of Sirhind, who opened
            their business establishments outside the Darshani Gate.[4] The
            royal house is now headed by Captain Amarinder Singh who is also the
            current Chief Minister of Punjab. The royals are considered cultural
            and political icons in east Punjab. Maharaja Karam Singh who ruled
            from 1813 to 1845 (the Sikh Kingdom of Patiala in Punjab) joined the
            British East India Company and helped the British during the First
            Anglo Sikh wars against the Sikh Empire of Maharajah Ranjit Singh of
            Punjab which was larger and extended from Tibet Kashmir, plains of
            Punjab to Peshawar near the Afghan borders.

          <h3>Governance</h3>
          <p>
            Patiala Municipal Corporation (PMC) is the local body responsible
            for governing, developing and managing the city. PMC is further
            divided into 50 municipal wards. Patiala Development Authority (PDA)
            is an agency responsible for the planning and development of the
            greater Patiala Metropolitan Area, which is revising the Patiala
            Master Plan and Building Bylaws. Patiala Development Department, a
            special department of the Government of Punjab, has been recently
            formed for overall development. Patiala consists of three assembly
            constituencies: Patiala Urban, Patiala Rural, Sanaur.
          </p>
          <h3>Culture And Traditions</h3>
          <p>
            Patiala's sway over the Malwa area extended beyond merely political
            influence. Patiala was equally the set of religious and cultural
            life. Educationally, Patiala was at the forefront. Patiala was the
            first town in this part of the country to have a degree in college –
            the Mohindra College – in 1870. Patiala has seen the evolution of a
            distinct style of architecture. Borrowing from the Rajput style, its
            beauty and elegance are moulded according to the local traditions.
            Phul Cinema on the Mall facing the Fountain Chowk is built in Art
            Deco style With the active patronage of the Maharajas of Patiala, a
            well-established style of Hindustani music called the "Patiala
            Gharana" came into existence and has held its own up to the present
            times. This school of music has had several famous musicians, many
            of whom came to Patiala after the disintegration of the Mughal Court
            at Delhi in the 18th century. At the turn of the century, Ustad Ali
            Bux was the most renowned exponent of this Gharana. Later, his sons
            Ustad Akhtar Hussain Khan and Ustad Bade Ghulam Ali Khan achieved
            worldwide fame and brought glory to the Patiala Gharana. After the
            partition of British India, Muslims were forced to flee the city en
            masse to Pakistan. At the same time, many Hindu and Sikh refugees
            migrated from Pakistan and settled on the Muslim properties in
            Patiala. The then Maharaja of Patiala, His Highness Yadavindra
            Singh, Rajpramukh of PEPSU with his wife Her Highness Maharani
            Mohinder Kaur organised a large number of camps and worked
            tirelessly for the people.
